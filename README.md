## About Strathy Unit App

Strathy Unit App is an interactive map that allows you to listen to sound samples submitted by users around the country as well as submit your own samples.

The purpose of the map is to explore dialect variation throughout the country. Users alos have the option of downloading files for their own analysis. 

The map was created by [Strathy Language Unit at Queen's University](http://www.queensu.ca/strathy/).

We welcome your feedback. Please contact us at [CVM@queensu.ca](mailto:CVM@queensu.ca).

### How do I use the map?
To listen to a recording, simply click on a marker to reveal a pop-up box with information on the speaker and an option to play or download a word. To zoom into a dense area, you can type an address/city/region into the search box. To add your own voice or download a set of files, click on the relevant tab and follow the instructions. Note that the "Add your voice" function only works with Chrome as your search engine.

### Why did you choose these words?
The words in the recording list were chosen to highlight different areas of possible dialect variation.
